自我介绍

Good morning espected professors!
It's my honor to participate in this interview.

My name is HongChenyang, 22 years old and my hometoen is JiXi, Anhui.
I studied at Anhui University of Technology, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

Now, I am doing my best to obtaining a chance to attend Southeast University-Monash Universicy Joint Graduate School.

Over the past four year, I have had a strong passion for computer science, 
I worked hard in undergraduate courses such as Data Structures, Operating Systems, and Databases.
I also learned from open-source projects online and read classic computer science books.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading books, listening music. 
I also like playing basketball, which taught me to keep trying and always do my best.

Southeast University is my dream school because of it's outstanding computer science program and rich studying atmosphere.
I aim to pursue graduate studies to deepen my understanding of computer science, boaden my horizons,and conduct more research in. 
I also want to improve my English ability through international collaborations.

普通问题

1.CET6
My English ability was not strong initially. When I decide to aim for seu, I committed myself to enhancing my abilities in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Unfortunately, I missed the CET6 exam due to unexpected circumstances. I am now dully prepared to get a satisfactory score in the next attempt.

2.竞赛和科研
I feel shame, Lack of research and competition experience is a regret of my undergraduate.
In the second year, I realized my shortcomings, so I haven taken algorithm courses, practiced algorithm problems on online judge .
I also engaged in academic discussions with my supercisor, which spark my interst in research.
If I am dortunate enough to pursue graduate studies, I will do my best in these three tears, compele mt research peojects and actively participate in competitions.

项目介绍

I developed a high-performance network library based on C++11 for Linux ,It's adopts an Event-driven model, using the one loop per thread approach. 
And it's main reactor handles client connections and distributies tasks to multiple worker threads.
Each sub-reactor leverages Linux's epoll mechanism to achieve I/O multiplexing.
The library re-encapsulates threads,TCP,logging and more .Itsuitable for building servers for chat, games and more.

项目相关问题

1.简单介绍epoll
Epoll is a Linux kernel mechanism for efficient I/O event monitoring by maintaining a red-black tree. 
Unlike select or poll, it uses a callback-based approach. 
epoll_create() to initialize, epoll_ctr() to manage fd and epoll_wait() to monitor enevts.

2.简单介绍多线程编程和网络编程
Multithreading enables concurrenr execution od task within a single process, improing performance in CPU or I/O.
The key of coding include thread synchronization and thread pools management. such as pthread_mutex_lock(), sem_init()/wait().
Network programming involves communication between devices over a network, typically using protocols like TCP/IP or UDP.
The key of coding include socket coding such as bind() listen() accept().

3.你是如何学习这个项目
Firstly, I studied Linux system programming and network prorocols.
Secondly, I analyzed open-source projects like libevent and Boost to learn design apporeach.
Finally, I seach online and ask teacher when I have problems.
